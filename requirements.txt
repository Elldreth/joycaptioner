# Requirements for JoyCaptioner
# To install with CUDA 12.6 GPU support, run:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# If you want CPU-only, comment out the --index-url and use the standard PyPI torch version.

# Use the PyTorch CUDA 12.6 index as an extra index so pip also searches PyPI for other packages
